# Vigour

Vigour is Fortran implementation of the VimScript specification as a VimScript -> C compiler fully separate from the `vim` application itself.


Currently, it is only a tokeniser with basic compilation capabilities (maths, `echo`, vars, if statements).

The only vimtypes supported are `Number` and `Float`
